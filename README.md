# "Keeper" Notepad Application

This project was created by Rhys Talley using React.

## Functionality

Creates a notepad application where users can write and store notes with both a title and a message field. Users can also delete notes that they've previously made. Notes are stored with a React useState array, and upon initialization, a few starting notes are displayed.
